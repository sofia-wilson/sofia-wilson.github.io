Welcome!
--------------
I am a PhD candidate in Education Policy and Developmental and Psychological Sciences at Stanford University. My research examines the role of place, parenting, and policy in shaping educational opportunities, with a particular focus on early childhood. I'm a recipient of Stanford's [Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education Doctoral Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/current-vpge-fellows/all-2023-fellows#EDGE) and the AIBM Graduate Research Fellowship.

Before Stanford, I worked in the education sector for more than a decade, as an Education Pioneers Fellow at [Start Early](https://www.startearly.org/), education technology leader at [Clever](https://www.clever.com/) and [Newsela](https://newsela.com/), and as a founding public school teacher in Boston and Oakland, where I was recognized as a Sue Lehmann Teaching in Excellence Regional Finalist and one of the 11 inspiring educators of the year by [The 74 Million](https://www.the74million.org/article/meet-the-heroes-11-inspiring-and-unforgettable-educators-we-met-in-2015/). I hold an Ed.M. in Education from Boston University and a B.A. in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I graduated summa cum laude as a [Robertson Scholar](https://robertsonscholars.org/). I'm originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Get in touch at sofia.wilson@stanford.edu -- I'm happy to discuss my research, prior work experience in schools, edtech, or early childhood nonprofits, as well as my experience as a PhD student at Stanford.
