Welcome! I am a doctoral student at Stanford University, where I study early childhood education, public policy, and the long-term effects of universal pre-K expansions. My research uses large-scale administrative and assessment data to study how education policies shape enrollment, inequality, and student learning. I also examine gender disparities in achievement, with a focus on how social structures and crises influence developmental trajectories.
