## Applied AI for K12

**Reproducible Claude Workflow for District Curriculum Adoption Processes**

I serve on a local district Curriculum Adoption Committee. As part of that work, I spent time manually pulling together evidence on high-quality instructional materials (EdReports) and program effectiveness (Evidence for ESSA), and synthesizing what I found into something useful for our committee's decision-making.

Curriculum adoption is already a heavy lift, and digging into considerable research hours to find, distill, and synthesize technical reports or combining multiple sources of evaluation to a cohesive summary adds another layer of work that many districts might not have time or staff capacity for. At the same time, district leaders and educators crave evidence-backed data to guide this important curricular decision.

So I built this tool as a way to make the process more accessible. It's a reproducible workflow that uses Claude to search EdReports and Evidence for ESSA, synthesize the findings, and generate a report with critical questions to ask vendors—all in a few minutes instead of several hours.

Below I provide instructions on how to copy and paste a prompt into Claude to generate your own report. This is very much a beta project. Feel free to share with district leaders and educators. If you try it out and have feedback, I'd welcome it.

### What It Does

1. **Part 1:** Searches EdReports for curriculum alignment and usability ratings
2. **Part 2:** Searches Evidence for ESSA for research studies meeting ESSA evidence standards
3. **Part 3:** Generates vendor questions based on evidence gaps
