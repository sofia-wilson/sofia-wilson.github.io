**Reproducible Claude Workflow for District Curriculum Adoption Processes**

Curriculum adoption is already a heavy lift, and digging into considerable research hours to find, distill, and synthesize technical reports or combining multiple sources of evaluation to a cohesive summary adds another layer of work that many districts might not have time or staff capacity for. At the same time, district leaders and educators crave evidence-backed data to guide this important curricular decision.

So I built [this tool](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/0b5c1c1c-2955-43e1-bff0-be3f2fbb1267) as a way to make the process more accessible. It's a reproducible workflow that uses Claude to search EdReports and Evidence for ESSA, synthesize the findings, and generate a report with critical questions to ask vendors—all in a few minutes instead of several hours. It replicates a manual workflow I used when supporting a local district with evidence-based curriculum evaluations.

Feel free to share with district leaders and educators. This is a beta project. If you try it out and have feedback, I'd welcome it.

### What It Does

1. **Part 1:** Searches EdReports to assess whether instructional materials meet High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) indicators. https://edreports.org/
2. **Part 2:** Searches Evidence for ESSA to evaluate whether rigorous research demonstrates that a curriculum improves student outcomes. https://www.evidenceforessa.org/
3. **Part 3:** Synthethisez findings and generates vendor questions based on evidence gaps
